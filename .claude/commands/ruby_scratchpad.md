Let's build out the ruby scratchpad for $ARGUMENTS.

Start by reading `docs/CLAUDE.md` for workflow overview and philosophy, and `docs/modelling/ruby_scratchpads.md`
for examples.

The initial feature discussion is at appended to the bottom of the scratchpad for reference. The
scratchpad at `docs/modelling/models/[feature]-scratchpad.rb` already has simple generator code in place.

Let's explore any other core code we should include in our initial implementation (controller instance variables,
key helper methods, etc.).
