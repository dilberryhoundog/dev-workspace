description: Lets build out some view sketches using scratchpads.

Let's create the CRUD view scratchpads for $ARGUMENTS. They're in `docs/pages/page_scratchpads/[feature]/`
along with an initial discussion document.

Start by reading `docs/CLAUDE.md` for workflow overview and philosophy.

Refer to `docs/pages/html_scratchpads.md` for examples and philosophy, and `docs/pages/placeholders.xml` for
available components.

You can create form partials or other shared partials if needed.
