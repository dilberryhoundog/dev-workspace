## Building the Application

...

### Discovery Stage

Collaborate with Claude, to describe the application's domain models and pages through specialised modelling and page building scratchpads.

### Setup Stage

Kick off a feature by building a task list. Of course, we must discuss what is on this list before creation.

### Development Stage

Work through the task list, one task at a time, building out the feature. Do more collaboration on the scratchpads if the feature needs extra work. Update the task list as necessary.

### Review Stage

Document the feature using the feature recording process outlined in `features/README.md`.
