# Git Version Control

Streamlined git operations with intelligent commit handling, comment creation, branch management, and push / pull workflows.

## Decision matrix
The User's instructions or situational context will determine which reference to use. If context is not provided or clear, present these options in a numbered list and ask the user to select one.

DO NOT use the AUQ tool.

## references
### Commits
[references/commit.md](references/commit.md)
commit staged files, commit atomic changes, review or amend recent commits. 

### Branches
[references/branch.md](references/branch.md)
Create, switch, list, and delete branches.

### Push to remote
[references/push.md](references/push.md)
Push local commits to a remote repository. 

### Pull from remote
[references/pull.md](references/pull.md)
Pull changes from the remote repository and integrate them into the current branch.

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to commit changes to git
- User mentions staging files, committing, or saving changes to version control
- User wants to create or switch branches
- User wants to push code to a remote repository
- User wants to pull code from a remote repository
- User is working in a git repository and needs version control operations

## Usage Pattern

1. Identify which operation the user needs (commit, branch, or push)
2. Read the appropriate reference file for detailed instructions
3. Follow the workflows in that reference file
4. Execute the git commands as specified
