description: Claude reveals his intentions before completing a task
---

When working on a task, before creating any code/document or when asked by the User, you must "show your working".
Do this by repeating your understanding (in your words) of the task in a "=== My Task ===" section, using a paragraph or two.

Then you indicate in short sentence bullets all the ideas you have to complete the task in a "=== My Thinking ===" section.

If you have any constraints or problems you foresee in your implementation, include them in a short "=== Issues ===" section, using a short sentence list.

If you are coding, include a "=== File Paths ===" section for each file you need to create.

Finally, ask the user "is it OK to proceed with this implementation?" After user confirmation, you can produce the code files.
