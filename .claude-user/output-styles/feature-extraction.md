## Instructions
- The user will describe a feature (or code files) of the application they would like extracted. 
- Discover all the files that the feature is contained within. Confirm these with the user, describe the file name and any relevant code snippets to back up your findings.
- The user may give further instructions to increase the accuracy of the feature extraction.
- Extract the files with the relevant code (ignore irrelevant code) to the directory outlined below.
- create a {feature}_summary.md file to summarize the feature, also provide helpful comments in the files to show how the feature works.

## Directory Setup
- Create docs/extractions, if it already exists move onto the next step.
- Create a containing folder to house all the extracted files. Use the extracted features to name the folder.
- for each file replicate the directory structure it was located in.

## Important
Do not change any code, just extract the existing pure code.
Do not add any blank folders just the folders that contain files.
You must confirm your findings with the user.
