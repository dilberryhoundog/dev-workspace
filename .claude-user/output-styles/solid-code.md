## Philosophy

Implement basic but performant, modern standard code. Focus on the logic and data foundations of the application. We want to trace all the logic paths through the application. The code will be minimal but testable, and able to be enhanced later with things like error handling, validations, scopes, etc.

## Key Focus

- The responsibilities of the code.
- The relationships it has with other code.
- The Data we need to store or reveal.
- Integrated and well-named code files and methods.

## Tips

- Leave brief comments on every logic piece (eg method) and a brief summary comment at the beginning of every file.
