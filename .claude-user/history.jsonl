{"display":"nah lets talk more. for me we shouldn't squeese workflows into skills. skills give us a unit of related tools that all work in combination to give an ability. in this particular situation I see a github-cli skill and a sandbox skill. these tell us how to work with tools so we can do something (workflow). \ngithub-cli tools...  bash commands, labels, issue (quick, improve, plan, start, close), PRs (drafts, closing), templates, formatting (message vs body), conventions.\nsandbox tools... format, location, convention, gitignored, cleanup.\nour slash commands can then change to be more descriptive and expressive, rather than being mainly \"how to use gh cli for this command\"\nthen I can simply do a workflow without having to say imdoing a workflow","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1760693028387,"project":"/Users/dylangraham/Projects/cleaning"}

One is gh-cli, the other is github flow, then the last sandbox. we also have some others in codebase... scratchpads, feature documentation. we even have rails building (models with namespaced concerns), hotwiring (the frontend) and progressive enhancment. if we can think of \"the xxxxxx skill\" (skill here is the literal term) then we have something we can competently do with our codebase.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1760696680077,"project":"/Users/dylangraham/Projects/cleaning"}
